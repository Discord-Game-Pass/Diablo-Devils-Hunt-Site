    <h2>If you are a member on this server</h2>
    <p>Please tell the admins to configure one or more channels for ducks to spawn.</p>

    <h2>If you are an admin on this server</h2>
    <p>Welcome and thanks for installing DuckHunt! ðŸŽ‰</p>
    <p>You might want to start by creating a specific channel for DuckHunt or enabling an existing one.
        In that channel, type
        <code>dhsettings enabled True</code>.
    </p>
    <p>You'll now need to adjust some settings to make it the perfect duck-paradise. Check the
        <a href="{{ url("bot_settings") }}"> settings page</a> to find what you can do to make DuckHunt even better.
    </p>
    <p>DuckHunt is made with love by Eyesofcreeper#0001, and translated by many volunteers.</p>
